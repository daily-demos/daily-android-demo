### Open or claim an issue

#### Open an issue

Today we work off two main issue templates: _bug reports_ and _demo/feature requests_.

_Bug reports_

Before creating a new bug report, please check to see if somebody else has [already reported the issue](https://github.com/daily-demos/daily-java-demo/issues).

If you create an issue, we'll ask you to tell us:

- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce the error
- Screenshots that illustrate where and what we should be looking for when we reproduce
- System information, like your device, OS, daily-client-android library version, and if applicable, browser
- Any additional context that you think could help us work through this

_Demo/feature requests_

We're always happy to hear about new ways you'd like to use Daily. If you'd like a demo that we don't have yet, we'll ask you to let us know:

- If the demo will help you solve a particular problem
- Alternative solutions you've considered
- Any additional context that might help us understand this ask

#### Claim an issue

Any issues labeled `good-first-issue` are up for grabs. If you'd like to tackle an existing issue, feel free to assign yourself, and please leave a comment letting everyone know that you're on it.

### Open a pull request

- If it's been a minute or if you haven't yet cloned, forked, or branched a repository, GitHub has some [docs to help](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).
